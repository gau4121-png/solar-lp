Issues found:
1. Large white gap between simulator CTA button and "編集部のイチオシ" section - wave divider may be creating too much space
2. The wave between simulator and recommend section has a large empty area
3. Need to scroll to check testimonials, contact form, and footer

Overall: Much improved from original. Professional look with consistent color scheme.
The spacing issue between sections needs fixing.
