### Idea 1: The "Transparent Professional" (誠実・実直)

*   **Design Movement**: Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) - Clean, objective, and grid-based.
*   **Core Principles**:
    *   **Clarity First**: Information is presented without distraction. High contrast for readability.
    *   **Trust through Structure**: A solid, predictable layout implies stability and reliability.
    *   **Objective Tone**: Visuals are realistic and unembellished, reinforcing the "third-party" perspective.
*   **Color Philosophy**:
    *   **Deep Navy (#0F172A)**: Represents authority, intelligence, and stability. Used for headers and primary text.
    *   **Crisp White (#FFFFFF)**: Maximizes negative space to create a sense of honesty and openness.
    *   **Signal Orange (#F97316)**: Used sparingly only for call-to-action elements, acting as a "warning" or "important" signal, guiding the user logically.
*   **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric Split. Instead of centered content, use a strong vertical axis where text sits on one side and supporting data/visuals on the other, creating a dialogue between problem and solution.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Thin Line Iconography**: Precise, engineering-style icons to represent solar panels, batteries, and money.
    *   **Data Cards**: Comparison tables and simulation results presented in distinct, shadowed cards that look like official reports.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**: "Click to Verify". Interactions are crisp and instant. Hover states on tables highlight rows clearly to aid comparison.
*   **Animation**: Minimal and functional. Elements fade in slightly as they scroll into view. The simulator numbers count up quickly like a calculator.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headings**: *Roboto* or *Inter* (Bold, tracking-tight) - Modern, standard, legible.
    *   **Body**: *Noto Sans JP* - Highly readable for Japanese text.

### Idea 2: The "Warm Future" (親しみ・安心)

*   **Design Movement**: Humanist Modernism - Technology serving people. Soft and approachable.
*   **Core Principles**:
    *   **Empathy**: Focus on the user's benefit (comfort, savings) rather than just the hardware.
    *   **Accessibility**: Large touch targets, readable fonts, and inviting colors.
    *   **Storytelling**: The page flows like a narrative, guiding the user from worry to relief.
*   **Color Philosophy**:
    *   **Warm Navy (#1E3A8A)**: A softer, slightly brighter navy that feels like a clear summer sky rather than a corporate suit.
    *   **Sunny Orange (#FB923C)**: Used more generously for gradients and highlights, evoking the warmth of the sun.
    *   **Cream/Off-White (#FFFAF0)**: Backgrounds are slightly warmed to reduce eye strain and feel more organic.
*   **Layout Paradigm**: Z-Pattern with Overlap. Sections flow into each other with overlapping elements (images breaking section boundaries) to create continuity and connection.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Rounded Containers**: All cards and buttons have generous border-radius, feeling friendly and safe.
    *   **Lifestyle Photography**: Images of families, comfortable homes, and bright rooftops rather than just industrial panels.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**: "Gentle Guidance". Buttons have a soft bounce on hover. The simulator uses sliders that feel tactile.
*   **Animation**: Smooth and flowing. Parallax effects on background elements. The simulator result "blooms" onto the screen.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headings**: *M PLUS Rounded 1c* - A rounded sans-serif that feels friendly but professional.
    *   **Body**: *Hiragino Kaku Gothic* or *Noto Sans JP* (Regular).

### Idea 3: The "Smart Choice" (論理・スマート)

*   **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism Lite - Bold, high-contrast, and slightly raw to emphasize "truth" and "cutting through the noise."
*   **Core Principles**:
    *   **Impact**: Large typography and bold borders to grab attention immediately.
    *   **Contrast**: Highlighting the difference between "bad choices" and the "smart choice" visually.
    *   **Efficiency**: Information is dense but organized. No fluff.
*   **Color Philosophy**:
    *   **Midnight Blue (#020617)**: Almost black, providing a high-contrast background for key sections.
    *   **Vibrant Orange (#EA580C)**: A high-energy orange used for the "Smart Choice" highlights and conversion buttons.
    *   **Stark White (#FFFFFF)**: Used for content blocks to make them pop against the dark background.
*   **Layout Paradigm**: Modular Grid / Bento Box. Content is compartmentalized into distinct blocks. The comparison section is a literal grid of "Winners" and "Losers."
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Thick Borders**: Elements have visible borders, emphasizing structure and separation.
    *   **Checkmarks & Crosses**: Exaggerated iconography to clearly denote "Good" vs "Bad" in the comparison.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**: "Tactile Feedback". Buttons depress visually when clicked. Hover effects invert colors for high impact.
*   **Animation**: Snappy and mechanical. No fades; elements slide or pop into place instantly.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headings**: *Oswald* or *Noto Sans JP* (Heavy/Black) - Tall, condensed, authoritative.
    *   **Body**: *Noto Sans JP* (Medium) - Strong and legible.
