Design Review Notes - Current State
====================================

Header:
- Logo text is plain text, no icon/logo mark
- "完全中立" badge is gray, not very distinctive
- Desktop nav works well, hamburger menu added for mobile

Hero Section:
- Background image with dark overlay - decent but generic
- Text hierarchy is OK but could be more impactful
- CTA buttons are functional but could stand out more
- Missing trust indicators (numbers, badges, certifications)

Problem Section:
- Gray background (#f9fafb) - very plain
- Alert icons are good but section feels sparse
- Right side image is a stock photo - could be more relevant
- "重要なのは..." overlay box is good design element

Comparison Table:
- Clean and functional
- "おすすめ" badge on recommended column is good
- Could use more visual differentiation for the recommended column

Simulator Section:
- Dark blue background with image overlay - good contrast
- Slider and results are functional

Recommend Section:
- Three cards with numbered headers (01, 02, 03)
- Clean but could be more visually engaging

Contact Form:
- Simple and functional

Footer:
- Basic two-column layout
- Could be more comprehensive

Overall Assessment:
- The site is functional but looks like a template/generic site
- Lacks the "専門サイト" (specialist site) feel
- Missing: trust badges, statistics counters, gradient accents, 
  professional typography, section dividers, micro-animations
- Color palette is basic (primary blue + orange secondary)
- Could benefit from more visual texture and depth
